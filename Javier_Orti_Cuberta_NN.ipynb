        "As a young computer science student and a [value investor][1] in the stock market, I always wondered if at some point I could do some research to fuse those different worlds in a fresh new project. Thats when I bumped into the world of machine learning, then deep learning, and now Neural Networks. Let me introduce to the new predicting model: *Cuberta*. \n",

        "## Project Setup:\n",
        "*Cuberta* consist in a multi-layered Neural Network that looks forward predicting the average stock price growth and the [dividend yield][2] of a company the next fiscal year, based on a series of fundamental stock analysis ratios.\n",
        "In order to keep everyone in track, lets leave an example:  \n",
        "\n",
        "In 2019, IBM had an average price of 126\\\\$ per stock.  \n",
        "In 2020, IBM had an average price of 114\\\\$ per stock, with a dividend yield of 0.052.\n",
        "The aim of *Cuberta* is to predict(the Y or Labels) the average stock price growth from 2019 to 2020 was 114/126=0.9047(which is actually degrowth) and a diviend yield of 0.052 per stock.\n",
        "\n",
        "As many readers will know, playing with $X \\in[-1, 1]$ rather than $X\\in{\\Bbb R}$ is, in general terms, a better idea for working with this type of algorithms, and that's what we will aim for.\n",
